    "Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use\n",
    "MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "Answer--ongoDB is a popular open-source NoSQL database management system that is designed for storing, retrieving,\n",
    "and managing large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. \n",
    "Non-relational databases are a type of database management system \n",
    "that do not rely on the traditional tabular relational database model used in SQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenarios where MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexible Schema\n",
    "Horizontal Scalability\n",
    "Big Data and Real-time Analytics\n",
    "Agile Development\n",
    "Geospatial Data \n",
    "Content Management Systems (CMS)\n",
    "Internet of Things (IoT)\n",
    "Caching\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "Answer--MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database management system known for its flexibility, scalability, and ease of use.\n",
    "Here are some of its key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "A)Schema-less Design:\n",
    "MongoDB is schema-less, allowing you to store data without a fixed structure. Documents within a collection can have different\n",
    "fields and data types,making it flexible for evolving data requirements.\n",
    "B)JSON-like Documents:\n",
    "Data in MongoDB is stored in BSON (Binary JSON) format, which is a binary representation of JSON documents. \n",
    "This makes it easy to work with data in a format that's similar to JavaScript objects.\n",
    "Document-Oriented:\n",
    "MongoDB uses a document-oriented data model, where data is stored in collections of JSON-like documents.\n",
    "Each document can contain nested arrays and subdocuments, \n",
    "making it suitable for complex and hierarchical data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "C)Dynamic Schema:\n",
    "You can add or remove fields from documents without affecting other documents in the same collection.\n",
    "This flexibility is particularly useful in agile development environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "D)Scalability:\n",
    "MongoDB is designed for horizontal scalability. You can distribute data across multiple servers or clusters to\n",
    "handle large datasets and high traffic loads. \n",
    "This is achieved through features like sharding.\n",
    "\n",
    "E)Automatic Failover:\n",
    "MongoDB supports automatic failover through replica sets. In the event of a primary server failure, \n",
    "a secondary server can automatically take over to ensure high availability and data redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "F)Rich Query Language:\n",
    "MongoDB provides a powerful query language that supports a wide range of queries, including geospatial queries,\n",
    "text searches, and aggregation pipelines for complex data manipulation.\n",
    "G)Indexes:\n",
    "MongoDB allows you to create indexes on fields to improve query performance. It supports various types of indexes,\n",
    "including compound indexes and geospatial indexes.\n",
    "\n",
    "H)Geospatial Capabilities:\n",
    "MongoDB has built-in support for geospatial indexing and queries, making it suitable for location-based applications and services.\n",
    "\n",
    "I)Aggregation Framework:\n",
    "MongoDB's aggregation framework allows you to perform complex data transformations, aggregations, \n",
    "and computations within the database itself, reducing the need for client-side processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "J)Full-Text Search:\n",
    "MongoDB offers full-text search capabilities, enabling you to perform text searches on text-rich data fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "K)Replication:\n",
    "MongoDB supports data replication for redundancy and high availability. It uses replica sets to maintain multiple copies of data across servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "L)Security:\n",
    "MongoDB provides robust security features, including authentication, role-based access control, SSL/TLS encryption, and auditing to protect your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "M)Community and Enterprise Editions:\n",
    "MongoDB offers both a free and open-source Community Edition and a paid Enterprise Edition with additional features, support, and management tools.\n",
    "Drivers and Ecosystem:\n",
